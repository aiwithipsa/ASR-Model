This repository contains an **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model** using **Wav2Vec2** to convert speech into text.  

### 🔹 Required Files  
To use this model, you'll need the following:  
1. **Pre-trained Model & Config Files** → Download from wav2vec2 **[wav2vec2]([your_drive_link_here](https://github.com/aiwithipsa/ASR-Model/tree/main/wav2vec2))** or **Hugging Face**  
2. **.wav Files (Dataset)** → Download from **[Google Drive](your_drive_link_here)**  

### 📌 How to Set Up  

#### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
Run the following commands in your terminal:  


2️⃣ Download & Place the Required Files
Put the .json files in wav2vec2/ directory
Put the .wav files in dataset/ directory

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Run this command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the ASR Model
python transcribe.py --audio dataset/input.wav

🛠 Fine-Tuning (Optional)
To fine-tune the model, follow the training instructions:
